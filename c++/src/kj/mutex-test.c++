    // So, it turns out that pthread_rwlock on BSD "prioritizes" readers over writers.  The result
    // is that if one thread tries to take multiple read locks, but another thread happens to
    // request a write lock it between, you get a deadlock.  This seems to contradict the man pages
    // and common sense, but this is how it is.  The futex-based implementation doesn't currently
    // have this problem because it does not prioritize writers.  Perhaps it will in the future,
    // but we'll leave this test here until then to make sure we notice the change.
